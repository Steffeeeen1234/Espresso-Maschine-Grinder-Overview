# Espresso-Maschine-Grinder-Overview

The goal is to provide an easy overview of used bean, used grinder and the used espresso maschine. 
This should help to reminde me which set up I used for which bean and it should also give everyone a hint which setuo could be the best for their espresso maschine.

# Website
I could imagine that the website has some kind of selector:
- grinder
- espresso maschine
- coffee bean
- preparation details
- picture of esspresso/coffee

the website should have a mobile and desktop design
